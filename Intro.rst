   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Introduction
==============================================================

Programming Team Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The programming team structure is TBD.


Function Diagrams
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With multiple people working on the code it is important for everyone to understand the inputs and outputs required for any fuction they are working on. These will be determined before any code is written to ensure that those inputs are available and we are duplicating effort. A function diagram should be created for each function using the template below.

Each function diagram should then be stored in the team's Google Drive programming folder and updated as needed throughout the season.


How To Divide and Conquer Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With multiple people working on the code at once it is important that we all follow some basic rules so we can easily merge the code together.

1. Work in separate branches as to not overwrite someone elses work.
2. Feel free to commit your code as often as you like, but atleast at the end of every session you work on it.
3. Follow the programming to electrical guide (interface control document ICD). If a change to it is required both the programming and electrical team leads need to agree to it.
4. Submit a pull request to merge code back into the master or other person's branch. Use this to share code, don't use email or usb sticks.
5. Follow the naming convention used for motors, controllers, etc. This style guide is at the top of Robot.cpp and helps make the code easier to understand for those who didn't write specific sections.
