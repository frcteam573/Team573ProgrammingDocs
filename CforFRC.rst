Introduction to C++ Programming
==============================================================
On Team 573 we have used C++ to program our FRC robots for the past 2 years. This section will hopefully give you a good starting point when you need to figure out how to do something for the team.

Where to Start Learning C++ Programming
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
There are many great websites to teach you how to use C++ code.Â I like code academy. If you want to get started from scratch in programming at home this is a great place to get started. The rest of this section briefly covers some of the things in C++ that we use in FRC robotics
