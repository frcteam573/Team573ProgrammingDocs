Driver Station For FRC
==============================================================
The driver station is a computer program that is used to control the robot in the shop and at compeitions.
It is divded into two parts:
FRC Driver Station
FRC Dashboard

FRC Driver Station
-------------------------------------------------------------
This is standard software provided by FIRST each year. We cannot modify it, but it is used to connect to the robot and control it.


FRC Dashboard - Elastic
-------------------------------------------------------------
We use Elastic as our dashboard software. Once connected to the robot you can add widgets, which are items the code already send to the SmartDashboard, to the dashboard.
You can drag and drop them around to arrange them how you like.
