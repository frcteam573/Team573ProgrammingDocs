FRC Path Planner
==============================================================

Why Should I Care?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
As the games have becoming more complicated the necessity for more complex autonomous modes has increased.
To do this with a swerve drive we've used Choreo and FRC Path Planner in the past to allow for path generation and following.

FRC Path Planner GUI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
FRC Path Planner (https://pathplanner.dev/home.html) is a GUI tool that allows you to create paths for your robot to follow.

It allows you to create waypoints and then generate a path that the robot can follow. You can also add in NamedCommands to allow the robot to perform actions at specific points along the path.
