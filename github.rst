Github
==============================================================
Github (https://github.com/) is an online code repository and it is were we host all our code. It allows use to branch the project out, so multiple people can work at once, and then easily merge it all back together through pull requests. We work in private repositories (repo) every season, then publish our final code after worlds. If you don't have access to this year's repo please talk to Coach Eric to get access.

It is free to create an account and you can make as many public repo's as you want for different projects.

Desktop Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
While the code is stored online it is worked on your local computer. So you need a way to send the files back and forth from the online repo. You can do this using command line tools, but it is much easier to use Github's Desktop client. You can install it here, https://desktop.github.com/
